  # The InChI string in the PDB ligand database has several errors, which force 
  # me to provide my own:
  # - The amide in the sidechain is replaced by the imidic acid tautomer.
  # - The chiralities of the 3'- and α- carbons are wrong.
  # - The phosphate oxygen is protonated.  According to wikipedia, AMP has 3 
  #   pKas: 0.9, 3.8, and 6.1.  Assuming that these refer to the 3 phosphate 
  #   protons, the proton is question would usually be absent at pH=7.
