# The following residues could possibly affect the shape of the binding pocket, 
# e.g. by contacting the residues that contact the NCAA (i.e. second-shell) or 
# by forming part of the hydrophobic core around the NCAA-binding pocket.

# Note that residues 203-209 are not present in this model, and the remaining 
# residues have been renumbered consecutively.  That means that residues 
# indices greater than 202 don't refer to the same residue in this scaffold 
# that they would most other contexts.  If you want to design any of these 
# residues (which shouldn't often be necessary, as none of them come very close 
# to the NCAA-binding pocket), double check that you have the right index.
